hi there!

//for using git first go into the folder - cd folderName -> git init -> 
//git add .  (it will add the file to the staging area) -> 
// git commit -m "whatever message you want" 
//we can use git checkout "fileName" for rollback
//we can use git log and git status for info 

//uploading the files from vs code to github
  //git remote add origin https://github.com/anubhutiprasad/Story.git  
  // git push -u origin main or git push --set-upstream origin master

//we can download the zip file of someones repo and use it by cloning
// git clone url-name

//branch and merge
//this allow for the parallel development of features or bug fixes (branching) and combining the changes back into the
//main codebase (merging), enabling collaboration and version control in a structured and organized manner.
//git branch your_branchName (for creating a branch)
//git branch (to see in which branch we are in) 
//git checkout branch-name (for going into that particular branch) and then we can work there and add files whatever we
//want by adding and committing it and then we get back to the main branch (i.e here the master branch) 
//and there we merge both of them by using git merge your_branchName
